Born in 1973, Laurent Allory studied at the Charpentier Academy of Plastic Arts in Paris (1992). 
He then turned towards visual communications and applied his talent with great success to the 
job of artistic director in an advertising firm. A visit to an exhibition in 1995 prompted him to 
renew with his initial passion for painting. Since then, he has explored various paths, drawing 
his inspiration from any theme such as African art, particularly African masks, to European 
modern art with a tendency towards graphics. He has researched the effects of using a diversity 
of materials by sometimes integrating forms in plaster, or collages made with findings gathered 
here and there such as pieces of wood, old newspapers or somewhat outdated advertising artwork, 
with his compositions of acrylic on canvas. After taking up photography in around 2000, through 
his research in urbanism, wasteland and building sites, and other desolate sites abandoned or due 
to be redeveloped, Allory has also used photography as a subject for his painting since 2005.
Finding the use of black and white photography compatible with this choice of direction, he has 
succeeded in giving aspecial emphasis to the uncertain future of these desolate landscapes, and
with his artists’ palette, he has revisited each photo with colour, giving them anew life. Black and 
white meets with colour... The smooth surface of the photographic print plays with the contours of 
acrylics; the stillness of the atmosphere and the inertia of these décors meet with the energies and 
the movements of the painter’s brush. Lives and works in Paris, France.
