Artist based in Madrid. Although he is best known for his work as illustrator in advertising, where his experience and reach is remarkable, in the last few years he has also successfully developed his personal line of art. His pieces make striking statements about female beauty through graphic and elegant images. His works are usually comprised of flowing and precise fine black lines, over which he deploys shocks of color accenting on clothing, faces, or environments. He uses dramatic gradients of colors and multiple layers that emerge from the images and involvement of the figures.  In order to fulfill his vision, he works with etching and he uses multiple artistic mediums and tools such as pencil, ink, marker, watercolor, and digital art.
