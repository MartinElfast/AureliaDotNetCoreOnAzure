1961 born in Karaganda / Kazakhstan
1982-1992 Studied painting from Valentin Golog
since 1994 freelance artist
„The pictures of the artist Paul Kaminski, who was born in Kazakhstan in 1961 and who is living in Wolfsburg
since 1993, share their dynamic application of colours with a fragile, almost poetic, serenity radiating character.
They show memories and imaginations, which he associatively transforms in colors and shapes.
Spontaneous applied patches of colour on white canvas usually form the beginning of his painting processes.
Following his inspiration, he develops his pictures from this spots, applying the oilpaint in many cases very fluid
and transparent with brush, spatula and cloth.
With chalk and charcoal he creates dynamic, delicate lines and figures at the same time.
Paul Kaminski is a restless spirit, who needs "to be constantly on the go" for his artistic work.
He works with contrasts, that give rise to areas of tension to keep the viewer fascinated:
Chaos and order, vitality and silence, coincidence and intention as well as abstract and concrete illustration...
The fascination of his pictures is to be found in the invitation of the viewer to take up this juggling game, 
to continue playing, to discover and to interpret on his own." (Doris Weiß)
