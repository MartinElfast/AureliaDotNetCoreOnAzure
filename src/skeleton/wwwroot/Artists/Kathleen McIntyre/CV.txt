About me:
I was born in California in 1962 and 
moved to Norway  at the age of 7. 
I now live in Oslo with my husband and daughter ,
working as television production manager for 
Norway's national broadcasting company 'NRK'.

My passion for photography started at an early age 
and I often find myself focusing on the kind of things that tend to go unseen,try to find something hidden. Abstract. Revealing something new from my surroundings. Capturing moods and details from daily life. Never previsualized. Never manipulated. Everything you see is what I saw in the camera . I like to work spontaneously, let it image just happend there in front of me. 
I officially entered the world of photography in 1996 with my debut exhibition 'Tomrom' at  Café Olsen in Oslo.  

I have studied under master photographers Morten Krogvold, Michael Ackerman, Arno Rafael Minkinnen and Joyce Tenneson.

Galleri Ramfjord (www.galleriramfjord.no) currently has some of my work on commission. 
They nominated my photo 'Outside' (portofolio Second Shadow) as one of the eight best among 35 competing  artists and I got selected as one of 30 among 400 for their juried exhibition august 2011.

All my work is for sale.
Printed on plexi, aluminum or paper.
